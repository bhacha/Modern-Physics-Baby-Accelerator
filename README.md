# school-stuff
This will be the home of very few, very random school projects. I'm a chem major so GitHub isn't generally my place, but physics classes have some things worth saving here.

The Modern Physics Computational Assignment is available as a .py or a .txt. Of course, they work the same, the .py is just nicely color coded here and should (!) open with python. It's written in Python 3.x, for what it's worth. 
The program itself was created for a fictional scenario in which a civilization accelerates all their babies so that at some point they are all the same age and are not disadvantaged by different birth dates. It's a simple math based entirely on time dilation from special relativity.

The RGB Converter is a very rough Python script (also 3.x) designed to convert RGB values into 0-255 HSL values. I want to emphasize that it's not a beautiful piece of code but works much more quickly (and more "black-boxy" now) than my calculator does. Its only real application was for a series of labs in a Chemistry and Art class.
